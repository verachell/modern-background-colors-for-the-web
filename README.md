# modern-background-colors-for-the-web
CSS for modern-looking div colors to add to your existing stylesheet. These are colors that I personally find useful when creating websites so I thought I'd share them here. 

They're typically light colors with a few darks; they all tend to be soft or muted, no oversaturated colors here. See [demo](https://verachell.github.io/modern-background-colors-for-the-web/) for how colors look and for extra usage info. Each defines a background and text color combo, so there's no need to define these separately. Dark background colors will automatically come with white text; light background colors will come with black text.

## Usage
The only file you'll need here is the CSS, `moderncolors.css`. Just add the contents to your existing stylesheet.
You can see demo for the colors at https://verachell.github.io/modern-background-colors-for-the-web/ 

### Typical use case
```
<div class="color-dustygreen">
<h3>Heading</h3>
<p>Paragraph content</p>
</div>
```
