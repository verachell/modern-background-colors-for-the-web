# modern-background-colors-for-the-web
CSS for modern-looking div colors for to add to your existing stylesheet. These are colors that I personally find useful when creating my own websites, so I thought I'd share them here. They're typcally light colors with a few darks; they all tend to be soft or muted, no oversaturated colors here. See demo for how colors look. Each defines a background and text color combo, so there's no need to define these separately. Dark background colors will come with white text; light background colors will come with black text.
